# bexam
bexam is an __App__ that can help __students__ get better __grades__ without even __learning more__. The idea behind is that you already have the _tests,essays,exams_ from the __year__ before or even longer and they can help you how to __understand__ what is being asked directly. Later on there will be a premium feature with doing quizzes for the upcoming exam.
