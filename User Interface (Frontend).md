The design needs to be __modern__ and not __complex__. There should be when entering the app for the first time, a login menu or to register a account and the data should be saved on the cache (cache implementation will be done later) and on the database.There also needs to be:

1) Window after login in to choose the school you go to
2) displaying all school subjects
3) after selecting the school subject, there needs to be a menu where you can select the class 
4) then there should be a menu where you select the wanted exam or test.
